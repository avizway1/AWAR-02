### **What is Linux?**  
Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) based on the Unix architecture. It is widely used for servers, desktops, mobile devices, and embedded systems due to its stability, flexibility, and security. The Linux OS consists of the **Linux kernel** (core system) and various software and tools provided by Linux distributions.  

Linux is a family of open-source, Unix-like operating systems that are built on the Linux kernel. The kernel, initially developed by Linus Torvalds, was first released on September 17, 1991.

### **Linux Directory Structure Overview**
The Linux file system is organized hierarchically, with `/` as the root. Each directory has a specific purpose, ensuring clear separation of system, user, and software files. Understanding these directories helps in managing and troubleshooting Linux systems effectively.

---

#### **1. `/` (Root Directory):**  
- **Purpose**: The top-level directory, the parent of all other directories.  
- **Analogy**: Similar to `C:\` in Windows.  
- **Key Note**: Everything in Linux starts from this root directory.

---

#### **2. `/root` (Root User’s Home Directory):**  
- **Purpose**: The home directory for the root user (superuser).  
- **Analogy**: Equivalent to `C:\Users\Administrator` in Windows.  
- **Key Note**: Provides a private workspace for the root user.

---

#### **3. `/home` (Users' Home Directory):**  
- **Purpose**: The home directory for regular (non-root) users.  
- **Analogy**: Equivalent to `C:\Users\<username>` in Windows.  
- **Key Note**: Each user gets a subdirectory within `/home`.

---

#### **4. `/bin` (Binary Executables):**  
- **Purpose**: Contains essential binary files used by all users (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).  
- **Key Note**: Commands in `/bin` are available in single-user mode and are critical for system operation.

---

#### **5. `/boot` (Boot Loader Files):**  
- **Purpose**: Contains the Linux kernel, boot configuration, and related files.  
- **Key Note**: Essential for starting the OS (e.g., `vmlinuz`, `grub`).

---

#### **6. `/dev` (Device Files):**  
- **Purpose**: Contains files that represent hardware devices like hard disks (`/dev/sda`) or CD-ROMs (`/dev/cdrom`).  
- **Analogy**: Similar to **Device Manager** in Windows.  
- **Key Note**: Provides an interface to interact with devices.

---

#### **7. `/etc` (Configuration Files):**  
- **Purpose**: Stores system-wide configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/resolv.conf`).  
- **Key Note**: Critical for system settings and service management.

---

#### **8. `/usr` (User Programs):**  
- **Purpose**: Contains user-level programs and libraries (e.g., installed software).  
- **Analogy**: Similar to `C:\Program Files` in Windows.  
- **Key Note**: It includes subdirectories like `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, and `/usr/share`.

---

#### **9. `/sbin` (System Binaries):**  
- **Purpose**: Contains system administration commands (e.g., `ifconfig`, `iptables`).  
- **Key Note**: Only root or superusers can execute commands here.

---

#### **10. `/var` (Variable Files):**  
- **Purpose**: Contains data that changes frequently (e.g., logs, databases).  
- **Examples**:  
  - Log files: `/var/log/messages`  
  - Databases: `/var/lib/mysql`  
- **Key Note**: Used for data that grows dynamically.

---

#### **11. `/mnt` (Mount Points):**  
- **Purpose**: Temporary mount point for file systems.  
- **Key Note**: Empty by default, used for manual mounting.

---

#### **12. `/media` (Removable Media):**  
- **Purpose**: Mount point for removable media (e.g., USB, CDs).  
- **Key Note**: Automatically used by the system for devices like pen drives.

---

#### **13. `/lib` and `/lib64` (Library Files):**  
- **Purpose**: Contains essential shared libraries used by programs.  
- **Analogy**: Similar to `.dll` files in Windows.  
- **Key Note**: Library files have `.so` (Shared Object) extensions.

---

#### **14. `/proc` (Process Information):**  
- **Purpose**: A virtual directory containing runtime system information (e.g., processes, RAM, CPU).  
- **Key Note**: Its contents change dynamically based on system state.

---

#### **15. `/opt` (Optional Software):**  
- **Purpose**: Contains optional third-party software and add-ons.

## **Process Management**

### Identifying and Managing Process IDs (PIDs) in Linux

#### **What is a PID?**
- A PID (Process ID) is a unique identifier assigned by the operating system to each running process.

---

#### **Commands to Identify PIDs and Manage Processes**

---

### 1. **`top`**

* **Description**: Shows a real-time view of running processes, system load, CPU, and memory usage.
* **Usage**:

  ```bash
  top
  ```
* **Example**:
  Start a test process:

  ```bash
  sleep 300 &
  ```

  Then run:

  ```bash
  top
  ```

  You’ll see the `sleep` process listed with its PID (Process ID), CPU, and memory usage.

---

### 2. **`ps`**

* **Description**: Shows the snapshot of current processes.
* **Usage**:

  ```bash
  ps
  ```
* **Example**:

  ```bash
  sleep 300 &
  ps
  ```

  You'll see the `sleep` command running with its PID, TTY, time, and command name.

---

### 3. **`ps aux`**

* **Description**: Shows a detailed list of all processes for all users.

  * `a` – shows processes for all users
  * `u` – shows user/owner of the process
  * `x` – shows processes not attached to a terminal
* **Usage**:

  ```bash
  ps aux
  ```
* **Example**:

  ```bash
  sleep 300 &
  ps aux | grep sleep
  ```

  Output includes:

  ```
  user     12345  0.0  0.0   1234   456 ?        S    21:00   0:00 sleep 300
  ```

---

### 4. **`htop`**

* **Description**: An interactive version of `top` with color and better UI. Use arrow keys to navigate and kill processes directly.

* **Usage**:

  ```bash
  htop
  ```

  *(If not installed, install it with `sudo apt install htop` or `sudo yum install htop`)*

* **Example**:

  ```bash
  sleep 300 &
  htop
  ```

  Use arrow keys to select the process and press `F9` to kill, `F10` to quit.

---

### 5. **`kill <PID>`**

* **Description**: Sends a signal to terminate a process by its PID. By default, it sends `SIGTERM` (signal 15) – a gentle request to stop.

* **Usage**:

  ```bash
  kill <PID>
  ```

* **Example**:

  ```bash
  sleep 300 &
  ps aux | grep sleep
  kill 12345   # Replace 12345 with actual PID
  ```

---

### 6. **`kill -9 <PID>`**

* **Description**: Sends `SIGKILL` (signal 9), which forcefully stops a process. Use only when normal `kill` doesn’t work.

* **Usage**:

  ```bash
  kill -9 <PID>
  ```

* **Example**:

  ```bash
  sleep 300 &
  ps aux | grep sleep
  kill -9 12345
  ```

### **Important User Management Commands in Linux**

1. **Create a New User**
   - Command:  
     ```bash
     sudo useradd username
     ```
2. **Set a Password for the User**
   - Command:  
     ```bash
     sudo passwd username
     ```
     This sets or updates the password for the user.

3. **Enable Password Authentication**
   - **Step 1:** Edit the SSH configuration file to enable password authentication:  
     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```
   - **Step 2:** Locate and update these lines:
     ```plaintext
     PasswordAuthentication yes
     ```
   - **Step 3:** Restart the SSH service to apply changes:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart sshd
     ```

4. **Switch to Another User**
   - Command:  
     ```bash
     su - username
     ```
     This command allows you to log in as another user and access their environment.
To add a user to the `wheel` group, which grants sudo permissions on many Linux distributions, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG wheel username
```
---

### Verify the User's Group Membership
After adding the user, you can verify their group memberships using:
```bash
groups username
```
---

### **Additional User Management Commands**

# File and Directory Permissions Management in Amazon Linux 2023
---

In Amazon Linux 2023, managing file and directory permissions is done using the `chmod`, `chown`, and `chgrp` commands. Below is a table that explains common permission commands using the **numeric method** (also known as octal notation).

---

### Understanding Numeric (Octal) Permissions

- **4** – Read (`r`)  
- **2** – Write (`w`)  
- **1** – Execute (`x`)  

The permissions are set in three levels:
- **User (Owner)**  
- **Group**  
- **Others (World)**  

### Numeric Values:
- `0` – No permission  
- `1` – Execute only  
- `2` – Write only  
- `3` – Write and execute  
- `4` – Read only  
- `5` – Read and execute  
- `6` – Read and write  
- `7` – Read, write, and execute  

---

### Permissions Management Commands Table

| **Command**    | **Description**                            | **Example**                     |

# SCP (Secure Copy) Command Guide

The `scp` command is used to securely transfer files and directories between systems over SSH.

---

## Basic Syntax

```bash
scp [options] source destination
```

---

## Transfer From Local to Remote

```bash
scp file.txt username@remote_ip:/path/to/destination/
```

- **file.txt** – Local file you want to copy
- **username** – Username on the remote server
- **remote_ip** – IP address or hostname of the remote machine
- **/path/to/destination/** – Target directory on the remote machine

**Example:**
```bash
scp myscript.sh ec2-user@192.168.1.10:/home/ec2-user/
```

---

## Transfer From Remote to Local

```bash
scp username@remote_ip:/path/to/file.txt /local/path/
```

**Example:**
```bash
scp ec2-user@192.168.1.10:/var/log/messages /tmp/
```

---

## Copy Directories Recursively

```bash
scp -r foldername username@remote_ip:/path/to/destination/
```

**Example:**
```bash
scp -r projects/ ec2-user@192.168.1.10:/home/ec2-user/
```

---

## Using Identity File (e.g., AWS .pem Key)

## Volumes Management in AWS

### **What is IOPS?**
**IOPS** stands for **Input/Output Operations Per Second**. It is a performance measurement used to describe the speed at which a storage device can read and write data. This metric is particularly important for applications that rely on high-performance storage, such as databases and high-traffic websites.

### **How IOPS is Calculated**
IOPS is calculated based on the following factors:

1. **Block Size:** 
   - The size of the data blocks being read or written.
   - Common block sizes are 4 KB, 8 KB, or larger.

2. **Latency:**
   - The time taken to process a single I/O request. This includes:
     - **Queue latency:** Time spent waiting in the queue.
     - **Disk latency:** Time taken by the storage media to complete the operation.

3. **Throughput:**
   - The rate at which data is transferred, typically measured in MB/s.

### **IOPS Formula**

**IOPS= Throughput×1024 / BlockSize**

- **Throughput** is in MB/s.
- **Block Size** is in KB.

### **Example**
If a storage device has:
- **Throughput:** 128 MB/s
- **Block Size:** 4 KB

The IOPS can be calculated as:

**IOPS= 128 ×1024 / 4 = 32,768IOPS**

---

### Making Additional Volumes Available

#### Windows OS
1. **Disk Management** (`diskmgmt.msc`):
   - Choose volume → Make it online → Initialize disk → Create simple volume → Format with NTFS/FAT.

#### Linux OS
1. **Identify New Volume**:
   - `lsblk`: List block-based devices.
   - `df -Th`: List available volumes.
   - Example: `/dev/xvdf` (new volume).

The `lsblk` and `df` commands in Linux provide information about disk and file systems, but they serve different purposes and present the information in distinct ways. 

  - `lsblk` is hardware-focused and shows all block devices, whether mounted or not.
  - `df` is file system-focused and only shows mounted partitions.


| **Command** | **Purpose** | **Output Focus** | **Key Use Cases** |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| `lsblk`     | Lists information about block devices. | Details about block devices, such as disks and their partitions (e.g., size, type, mount points). | Viewing disk layout, identifying devices, and checking partitions and mount points. |
| `df`        | Displays disk space usage of file systems. | File system storage details (e.g., total size, used, available, and percentage of use). | Monitoring file system usage, checking disk space on mounted file systems. |



2. **Prepare Volume**:
   - Check file system: `file -s /dev/xvdf`.
     - Output “data”: No file system.
     - Output ext3/xfs: File system present.
   - Create file system: `mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf`.
   - Create mount point: `mkdir newvolume`.
   - Mount volume: `mount /dev/xvdf newvolume/`.

3. **Make Mount Persistent**:
   - Check current mounts: `cat /etc/mtab`.
   - Example Entry:
     ```
     /dev/xvdf /home/ec2-user/newvolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota 0 0
     ```
   - Add entry to `/etc/fstab`:
     ```
     /dev/xvdf /home/ec2-user/newvolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota 0 0
     ```
   - Apply changes: `mount -a`.

---

### Increasing Volume Size with Amazon Linux 2
1. Increase the size in the AWS console.
2. Install `xfsprogs`: `yum install xfsprogs`.
3. Expand volume:
   ```
   xfs_growfs -d /volume-Mountpoint
   xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/newvolume
   ```

### Increasing Volume Size with Amazon Linux 2023
1. Increase the size in the AWS console.
2. Install `growpart` (if not available).
3. Expand the partition first:
   ```
   growpart /dev/xvda 1
   xfs_growfs -d /volume-Mountpoint
   xfs_growfs -d /
   ```

**Note**: Decreasing volume size is not supported at movement.
